# 🧮 Part B — DEF PLC Corporate Finance Evaluation

## 1️⃣ Capital Budgeting — NPV & IRR

### Base Case Findings:
- **NPV:** **£2.82 million** (positive → accept project)  
- **IRR:** **20%** (higher than required 14%)  

This confirms that the new product investment adds shareholder value.

---

## 2️⃣ Sensitivity Analysis
### Selling Price Sensitivity:
- **+10% price:** NPV = £6.08m | IRR = 26%  
- **–10% price:** NPV = –£0.44m | IRR = 13%  
→ **Highly sensitive to pricing.**

### Sales Volume Sensitivity:
- **–10% units:** NPV stays positive (£1.10m)  
→ Lower impact vs. price changes.

---

## 3️⃣ Share Price Valuation — Dividend Discount Model (DDM)
- **Intrinsic Value:** £3.25  
- **Market Price:** £4.00  

**Stock is overvalued.**  
→ Good time for the company to issue new shares with reduced dilution.

## 4️⃣ Financing Decision — Raise £100 Million

### Financial Indicators:
- Debt-to-Equity = **0.576**  
- Interest Cover = **9.93×**  
- ROE = **19.34%**

### Recommendation: **Hybrid Financing (55% Debt, 45% Equity)**  
**Why?**
- Debt is tax-efficient (interest deductible)  
- Equity takes advantage of market overvaluation  
- Balanced risk profile  
- Maintains financial stability  
- Avoids overleveraging
